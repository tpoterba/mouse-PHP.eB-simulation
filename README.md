# mouse-PHP.eB-simulation

This respository contains code used as part of the [2019 paper, "Delivering genes across the blood-brain barrier: LY6A, a novel cellular receptor for AAV-PHP.B capsids"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/538421v1). The included [notebook](mouse-PHP.eB-simulation.ipynb) was used to estimate the required number of mice to test in order to isolate a sufficiently-small list of candidate mendelian factors for blood brain barrier viral permissivity.
